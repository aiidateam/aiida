**Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational
Science**

AiiDA is a sophisticated framework designed from scratch to be a
flexible and scalable infrastructure for computational science. Being
able to store the full data provenance of each simulation, and based on
a tailored database solution built for efficient data mining
implementations, AiiDA gives the user the ability to interact seamlessly
with any number of HPC machines and codes thanks to its flexible plugin
interface, together with a powerful workflow engine for the automation
of simulations.

For instructions on how to install AiiDA, see the [documentation](http://aiida-core.readthedocs.io).
